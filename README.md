I am Jose Anton Paolo F. Losaria, but you can call me Anton or Ton for short.

I quite like doing calisthenics but due to lack of time during the end of the first semester, I stopped and just got back to it during the short two week break.
Some others are playing video games of all kinds of genres, and reading light novels and web novels that I find interesting. This also includes watching anime and one of the favorites being 86.

Regarding other details, I am quite laid-back but when it comes it school work sometimes I am quite strict with myself and other times laid-back as well. It usually depends
on what kind of activity it is.
